Android MVVM Project with Using jetpack
This is an Android  project on MVVM(Model View View-Model) Pattern.

1. Ingests a json feed from https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/2iodh4vg0eortkl/facts.json. 
2. Displays the content in a ListView • The title in the ActionBar should be updated from the json data. 
3. Each row should be dynamically sized to display its content, no clipping, no extraneous white-space etc.  
4. Loads the images lazily. 
5. Allows the data/view to be refreshed, via either: • A refresh button • Pull down to refresh 
Along with native android data binding, libraries used to acheive MVVM pattern are retrofit (to consume api data) and reactivex (reactive programming).
6. The app should target Android version 4.0. Don’t worry about backwards compatibility for this task.
7. The list should scroll smoothly. As much work as possible should be cached. 

This app gets dummy json data from https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/2iodh4vg0eortkl/facts.json and displays it in recycler view. App shows detail view after lunch application.
